## ℹ️ About The Project

This repository is dedicated to my website that features a player counter for the Evrima server.
The player count is retrieved from the **`player_count.txt`** file, which is automatically updated by my Git bot connected to the Evrima server.
As a result, visitors to the website can easily keep track of the number of players online.
We take great pride in being at the forefront of The Isle community.
