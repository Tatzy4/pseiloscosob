## About The Project ❔

This repository is for my website that uses **`player_count.txt`** to display the number of players online.
The **`player_count.txt`** file is updated by my Git bot connected with the Evrima server.
Currently, I'm not sharing the source code as I don't want to deal with additional issues.
We are the first in The Isle, so yeah.
